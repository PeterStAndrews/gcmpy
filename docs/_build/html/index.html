<h1>Welcome to gcmpy: a toolkit for random graph creation for network science<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-gcmpy-a-toolkit-for-random-graph-creation-for-network-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcmpy</span></code> aims to provide a common framework for the scalable and
efficient creation of random graphs in python that are constructed
according to the generalised configuration model algorithm.</p>
<section id="what-are-configuration-model-networks">
<h2>What are configuration model networks?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-configuration-model-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Networks are collections of vertices connected together by edges. A mathematician
might call a network a <em>graph</em>, and we use the two terms indiscriminately. Networks provide
an excellent opportunity to bring both dynamics and topology into a single model. In this context
questions on how topology influences the dynamics are readily answered by a network model. For instance,
in a <em>contact network</em>, the vertices of the graph represent people, and the edges represent those
contacts that are sufficient to transmit disease. One could then inject a dynamical process over
this network, such as an epidemic disease that transmits from contact to contact. Varying the structure
of the contact network, perhaps through mitigation strategies such as social distancing, might change
how the epidemic behaves at the population level.</p>
<p>Networks can be collected from empirical data, or they can be created according to a given algorithm.
Empirical networks are only a single graph; whilst, synthetic algorithms can be used repeatedly to
create different graphs. In general, graph construction algorithms are stochastic by nature, meaning
that they have randomisation in them. This leads to a different final network for a given input dataset.
As such, a <em>family</em> of random graphs can be created with equivalent statistical properties. Upon each
application of the algorithm, a single member of the random graph family is generated.</p>
<p>One such random graph algorithm is the <em>configuration model</em> (CM). In the CM, each vertex in a set
of unconnected vertices is assigned an integer, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>, that represent it’s number of edges - called its degree.
The vertices are then entered into a list once for each of its edges, such that, a vertex with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> edges
is present exactly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> times in the list. Once all vertices have been entered, the list is shuffled
and vertex pairs are drawn without replacement from the list. The vertices are then connected together. Once
all pairs have been drawn from the list, the construction algorithm is completed. Theoretically, the same vertex
can be drawn from the list twice, and therefore, self-loops can be created; however, for large networks, this
is rare.</p>

<section id="what-are-generalised-configuration-model-networks">
<h2>What are generalised configuration model networks?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-generalised-configuration-model-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the CM, pairs of vertices are connected together at random. This leads to networks that are
<em>locally tree-like</em> and do not contain short range cycles. In the contact network example above
this indicates that an individuals friends do not have contact with one another, which is highly
unrealistic. These types of relationships often have a very large influence on the properties of
the network!</p>
<p>The <em>generalised configuration model</em> (GCM) allows higher-order connections, beyond simple edges, to be added to the graph whilst
still generating random graphs. An edge is a pair-wise interaction. The next interaction we can consider is
an interaction between 3 vertices, such as a triangle. Let us consider a GCM network that contains both ordinary edges
and triangles. To begin, each vertex in an unconnected set of vertices is assigned two integers: one representing
its number of ordinary edges, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, and the second representing the number of distinct triangles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, it belongs to. Two lists are
now created and each vertex is entered once for each of its ordinary edges to the first list, and once for each of its
triangles to the second. Once all vertices have been added to the lists they are sboth huffled. In a similar
manner to the CM algorithm, pairs of vertices are drawn from the ordinary edge list and connected together until it is empty; whilst triples
of vertices are drawn from the triangles list and connected together in a triangle until it too is empty. Upon completion
we now have a random network that contains ordinary edges and triangles.</p>
<p>The choice of motif can certainly be extended beyond ordinary edges and triangles. Indeed, any graph motif can be used.
This allows a great freedom in the kinds of networks that we can create and the types of natural phenomena we can model!</p>

<h2>What is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcmpy</span></code>?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-gcmpy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcmpy</span></code> is a pure Python simulation framework that facilitates the synthesis of GCM networks from a variety of
input formats. It aims to provide the common simulation approaches used in
the scientific literature, together with a small set of “common
networks” that can form the basis for experimentation.</p>
